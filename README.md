Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset!

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset for classification and is often used as a test case for machine learning algorithms. It consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, with four features recorded for each: the length and width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The target variable is the species of the flower, which can be one of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica.

In this EDA, we will be exploring the Iris dataset to gain a better understanding of the data and to identify any trends or patterns that may exist. This will involve visualizing the data, computing summary statistics, and identifying any relationships between the features and the target variable.
